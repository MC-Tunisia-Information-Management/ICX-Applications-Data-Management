# ICX-Applications-Data-Management
The script labeled "ICX Applications" facilitates the extraction and updating of data from AIESEC's API into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The `dataExtraction` function sends a GraphQL query to retrieve opportunity application data based on specified filters like creation date and program type, utilizing an access token for authentication. The retrieved data is parsed and returned. The `dataUpdating` function, triggered by a custom menu item in Google Sheets, retrieves application data created after a specified start date, iterates through each application, checks for duplicates in the spreadsheet, and either adds new rows with relevant details such as applicant information, opportunity details, and status, or updates existing rows with the latest status information. It also logs successful updates and timestamps in the "Interface" sheet. This automation helps streamline the process of managing and tracking application data within AIESEC's operations.
